    "The normal distribution has several features that make it popular. First, it can be fully characterized by just two parameters – the mean and the standard deviation – and thus reduces estimation pain. Second, the probability of any value occurring can be obtained simply by knowing how many standard deviations separate the value from the mean; the probability that a value will fall 2 standard deviations from the mean is roughly 95%.   The normal distribution is best suited for data that, at the minimum, meets the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is a strong tendency for the data to take on a central value.\n",
    "* Positive and negative deviations from this central value are equally likely\n",
    "* The frequency of the deviations falls off rapidly as we move further away from the central value.\n",
    "The last two conditions show up when we compute the parameters of the normal distribution: the symmetry of deviations leads to zero skewness and the low probabilities of large deviations from the central value reveal themselves in no kurtosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a cost we pay, though, when we use a normal distribution to characterize data that is non-normal since the probability estimates that we obtain will be misleading and can do more harm than good. One obvious problem is when the data is asymmetric but another potential problem is when the probabilities of large deviations from the central value do not drop off as precipitously as required by the normal distribution. In statistical language, the actual distribution of the data has fatter tails than the normal. While all of symmetric distributions in the family are like the normal in terms of the upside mirroring the downside, they vary in terms of shape, with some distributions having fatter tails than the normal and the others more accentuated peaks.  These distributions are characterized as leptokurtic and you can consider two examples. One is the logistic distribution, which has longer tails and a higher kurtosis (1.2, as compared to 0 for the normal distribution) and the other are Cauchy distributions, which also exhibit symmetry and higher kurtosis and are characterized by a scale variable that determines how fat the tails are. Figure 6A.7 present a series of Cauchy distributions that exhibit the bias towards fatter tails or more outliers than the normal distribution."

    "In probability and statistics, Student's t-distribution (or simply the t-distribution) is any member of a family of continuous probability distributions that arises when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown. It was developed by William Sealy Gosset under the pseudonym Student.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution plays a role in a number of widely used statistical analyses, including Student's t-test for assessing the statistical significance of the difference between two sample means, the construction of confidence intervals for the difference between two population means, and in linear regression analysis. The Student's t-distribution also arises in the Bayesian analysis of data from a normal family.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take a sample of $n$ observations from a normal distribution, then the t-distribution with {\\displaystyle \\nu =n-1}\\nu=n-1 degrees of freedom can be defined as the distribution of the location of the sample mean relative to the true mean, divided by the sample standard deviation, after multiplying by the standardizing term {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {n}}}{\\sqrt {n}}. In this way, the t-distribution can be used to construct a confidence interval for the true mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, like the normal distribution, but has heavier tails, meaning that it is more prone to producing values that fall far from its mean. This makes it useful for understanding the statistical behavior of certain types of ratios of random quantities, in which variation in the denominator is amplified and may produce outlying values when the denominator of the ratio falls close to zero. The Student's t-distribution is a special case of the generalised hyperbolic distribution."
